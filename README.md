# PROM-Dumper
Using an Arduino, dump a AM27S19DC 256Bit (32x8) Bipolar PROM from AMD. 

# Untested
Wasn't compiled or tested yet. Will update the code and readme when I get a chance to compile and test.

# Why?
I need a dumper for some Textronix gear's PROMs and my Xgecu T56 doesn't support the AM27S19DC chip nor any of it's drop in replacements.
